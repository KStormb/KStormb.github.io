      <p>The Stormlight Archive has for a long time been seen as far too large and ambitious to ever leave the pages, however with how far TV has come, and with better and better technology, it might finally be possible. In a livestream this year, Brandon Sanderson teased that Hollywood has given him some generous offers on a potential series, which means hopefuly we will be able to see Roshar in all it's glory sometime in the near future.</p>
           
      <div class="Concern">
    
      <p><span class="dropcap">A longtime concern with</span> the Stormlight Archive among fans has been that it's simply just <i>too</i> bizzare for television, and only works when imagined by the readers mind. Roshar is a truly alien world, "a coral reef lifted above the sea and left for centuries to human hands" It is of course enhabited by the mysterious Spren, who would need to be brought to life by CGI and woudl be a constant part of the drama. And none of that even touches the massive battles, gatherings and setpeices that would need to be brought to life. All of that is to say that a longstanding concern has been that it would simply cost too much money to make on a series that already has not been proven to be success on television.</p>
